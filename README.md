## How to Install and Run the Project
**Install dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project directory and type npm install <dependency-name> to install each dependency listed in the package.json file. Repeat the command for all necessary dependencies.

**Start the development server:** Once the installation is complete, run the command npm run dev. This will start the application in development mode.

**Find the port:** The terminal will display the port number on which the app is running locally. Take note of this number, for example, 3000.

**Access the app:** Open your browser and enter the port number directly in the URL bar. For example, if the port is 3000, enter localhost:3000.
