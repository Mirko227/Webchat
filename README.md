# How to Install and Run the Project
## Install dependencies:
Open your terminal in the project directory and type npm install <dependency-name> to install each dependency listed in the `package.json`. Repeat the command for all necessary dependencies.

##Start the development server:
Once the installation is complete, run the command ````npm run dev````. This will start the application in development mode.

##Find the port:
The terminal will display the port number on which the app is running locally. Take note of this number, for example, 3000.

##Access the app:
Open your browser and enter the port number directly in the URL bar. For example, if the port is 3000, enter localhost:3000.
